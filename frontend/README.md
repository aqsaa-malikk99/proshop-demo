4. **Adding Product Details:** Developed additional components, `Rating` and `Product`, for use within both `HomeScreen` and `ProductScreen`.
5. **Implementing Routing:**
   - Used `react-router-dom` to set up routing, allowing seamless navigation between `HomeScreen` and `ProductScreen`.
   - Created `ProductScreen` to dynamically display details of the product selected on `HomeScreen`.

## Technologies Used
