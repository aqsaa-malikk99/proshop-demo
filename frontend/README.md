# ProShop v2 Demo

This is a React application demo for a shopping platform called **ProShop v2**. It is a fully functional e-commerce web application featuring essential shopping features such as product listings, product details, and routing.

## Project Structure

- **Components:** Modular, reusable components such as `Header`, `Footer`, `Rating`, and `Product`.
- **Screens:** Specific views or screens like `HomeScreen` and `ProductScreen` for showcasing the latest products and product details, respectively.
- **Routing:** Implements `react-router-dom` for navigating between different screens.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the ProShop v2 demo locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
````

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd proshop-v2-demo
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Initial Development

The initial setup and development included:

1. **Creating Components:** Developed core components, such as `Header` and `Footer`, to structure the layout.
2. **Setting up `App.js`:** Incorporated `Header` and `Footer` components within `App.js` to establish a consistent layout across the app.
3. **Creating Screens:**
   - Built the `HomeScreen` to display a list of the latest products.
   - Integrated `products.js` to manage and showcase product data on `HomeScreen`.
4. **Adding Product Details:** Developed additional components, `Rating` and `Product`, for use within both `HomeScreen` and `ProductScreen`.
5. **Implementing Routing:**
   - Used `react-router-dom` to set up routing, allowing seamless navigation between `HomeScreen` and `ProductScreen`.
   - Created `ProductScreen` to dynamically display details of the product selected on `HomeScreen`.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - Frontend framework
- **React Router** - For handling navigation and page routing
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Core programming language
- **HTML5 & CSS3** - Basic structure and styling

## Future Work

Plans for expanding the app may include features like user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and payment integration.

# New Work

Alright, team!

Before we dive into the backend, let’s first get a clear idea of how our full-stack application workflow is going to function.

### Frontend Overview

We’ve already made progress on our **frontend**, or client side, which is organized in a folder named **Front End**. This is where our **React** code lives, along with **Redux** for managing our application’s state. Everything here involves the **user interface (UI)** and interaction with users.

### Backend Setup

In the next step, we’ll be working on our **backend** with **Node.js** and **Express**. This is where we’ll set up our **server** and build **routes** for different actions:

- **Product Management**:

  - We'll create a route at `/api/products` to handle requests:
    - **GET** request to retrieve products.
    - **POST** request to add a new product (with product details sent in the request body).
    - **PUT** and **DELETE** requests to update or delete a product by specifying its ID (e.g., `/api/products/:id`).

- **Orders, Users, and Reviews**: We'll follow similar patterns for **orders**, **users**, and **product reviews**.

### Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

For authentication, we’ll use **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. Unlike some setups that store tokens in the client’s local storage, we’ll use a more secure approach by keeping it in an **HTTP-only cookie** on the server. This way, the client can’t read the token directly, which helps prevent certain security risks.

An **auth middleware** will validate this token to authenticate users and authorize actions based on their role.

### User Roles: Regular and Admin

Our app will support two types of users:

1. **Regular Users (Shoppers)** - can browse products, create orders, and make purchases.
2. **Admin Users** - have full control, including creating, updating, and deleting products, managing orders, changing statuses, and removing users.

### Database Setup

We’ll store our data in **MongoDB**, specifically using **MongoDB Atlas** (the cloud-hosted version). For interacting with MongoDB, we’ll use **Mongoose**, an Object Data Mapper (ODM) that simplifies querying and managing data in MongoDB.

### What’s Next?

This was a high-level overview to give you a mental picture of the workflow. Next, we’ll start building our **Node.js and Express server** and gradually add in these functionalities.

Let’s get started!
